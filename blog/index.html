        <h1>Wine Basics</h1>

        <p>Most wine is made with grapes, but they're not like the ones you find in the grocery store. Wine grapes
            (latin name: Vitis vinifera) are smaller, sweeter, have thick skins, and contain seeds. There are over 1,300
            wine grape varieties used in commercial production but only about 100 of these varieties make up 75% of the
            world's vineyards. Today, the most planted wine grape in the world is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabernet_Sauvignon" target="_blank">Cabernet Sauvignon</a>  ("cab-err-nay
            saw-vin-yon").</p>

        <h3 id="what">What is Wine?</h3>

        <p>Wine is an alcoholic beverage made with the fermented juice of grapes. Technically, wine can be made with any
            fruit (i.e. apples, cranberries, plums, etc) but if it just says “wine” on the label then it’s made with
            grapes. (By the way, wine grapes are different than table grapes).</p>

        <p>Speaking of differences, the difference between wine and beer is that beer is made from brewed grains that
            are then fermented. So very simply, wine is made from fruit and beer is made from grains. Of course, there
            exceptions –that push the boundaries of beer,–but that story is for another time.</p>

        <h3 id="grapes">What are Wine Grapes?</h3>

        <p>LWine grapes are different than table grapes: they are smaller, sweeter and have lots of seeds. Most wines
            are made with a single species of grape that originated in Caucasus called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitis_vinifera">Vitis vinifera</a> .​</p>

        <p>There are thousands of different varieties within the Vitis vinifera species–the most common is Cabernet
            Sauvignon.​</p>

    <div class="container box-third">
        <h2 id="taste">The Taste of Wine</h2>

        <p>There are several facets that explain wine’s unique flavor: acidity, sweetness, alcohol, tannin, and aroma
            compounds produced in fermentation.</p>

        <h3 id="acidity">Acidity</h3>

        <p>Wine as a beverage lies on the acidic end of the pH scale ranging from as low as 2.5 (lemon) to as high as
            4.5 (greek yoghurt). Wine tastes tart.</p>

        <h3 id="sweet">Sweetness</h3>

        <p>Depending on what style of wine you drink, sweetness in wine ranges from having no sugar at all to sweet like
            maple syrup. The term “dry” refers to a wine without sweetness.</p>

        <h3 id="alchool">Alcohol</h3>

        <p>The taste of alcohol is spicy, palate-coating and warms the back of your throat. Wine’s average range of
            alcohol is about 10% ABV (alcohol by volume) to 15% ABV. Of course, there are a few exceptions: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscato_d%27Asti">Moscato
                d’Asti</a>  is as low as 5.5% ABV and Port is fortified with neutral brandy upping it to 20% ABV.</p>

        <h3 id="tannin">Tannin</h3>

        <p>Tannin is found in red wines and contributes to the astringent quality of red wine. Put a wet, black tea bag
            on your tongue for a great example of how tannin tastes.</p>

        <h3 id="aroma">Aroma Compounds</h3>
        <p>Within the tiny minutia of wine (the phenols, esters, higher alcohols, acids, etc) is where you’ll find the
            complexities to wine’s flavors and aromas. Each grape variety exhibits aroma compounds at different levels.
            This is why some wines smell like berries and others smell like flowers. Another contributing factor to
            wine’s aromas is aging. Nearly all red wines are aged in oak, which not only contributes an oak barrel’s
            flavor compounds (like vanillan) but also acts as a conduit to expose the wine to oxygen. Oxidation and
            aging produce a range of unique flavors to wine including nuttiness, and dried fruit/flower flavors.</p>
